# Hello dev

If you want to learn `Golang` then you are in the right place.
This repository implements all the corrected exercises from the site [a tour of go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).
You will find the documentation necessary for the implementation of the functions in the set of corrections

## How is it organized?

All the corrections are implemented by progression sequence as seen in the course. You can consult these corrections as you wish.

## Why this repository?

Personally when I followed the course for the first time. I had a little trouble implementing some functions of the exercises. Often taking me a few days (because yes I had just started programming and as a self-taught person it was really tough).
Consider this repo as a reference when you are stuck on one of the exercises of the course and you can therefore consult it to have a quick idea on how to solve it.
